# Project Architecture & Featured System Documentation

## ✅ **Current Setup Analysis - Matches Your Requirements!**

### **Project Categories & Routes**
Your setup is perfectly configured for your requirements:

#### **1. Fine Art Projects**
- **Route**: `/portfolio/fine-art`
- **Sanity Value**: `projectType: 'fine-art'`
- **Navigation**: ✅ Available in Work dropdown
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional

#### **2. Tech Projects** 
- **Route**: `/portfolio/tech-projects`  
- **Sanity Value**: `projectType: 'technology'` ✅ **FIXED**
- **Navigation**: ✅ Available in Work dropdown
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional

#### **3. Urban Planning Projects**
- **Route**: `/portfolio/urban-planning` ✅ **CREATED**
- **Sanity Value**: `projectType: 'urban-planning'`
- **Navigation**: ✅ **ADDED** to Work dropdown
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional

## 📋 **Admin Upload to Website Display Flow**

### **Step 1: Admin Uploads Project**
When you upload a project in Sanity Studio:

1. **Choose Project Type**: Select from dropdown:
   - `Fine Art` → `projectType: 'fine-art'`
   - `Technology` → `projectType: 'technology'` 
   - `Urban Planning` → `projectType: 'urban-planning'`

2. **Set Featured Status**: Toggle the `Featured` checkbox:
   - `featured: true` → Project appears in featured rotations
   - `featured: false` → Project appears in category but not featured

### **Step 2: Website Display Logic**

#### **Category Pages Display ALL Projects**
Each category page shows ALL projects of that type:

- **Fine Art Page**: Shows `projectType === 'fine-art'` projects
- **Tech Projects Page**: Shows `projectType === 'technology'` projects  
- **Urban Planning Page**: Shows `projectType === 'urban-planning'` projects

#### **Featured Projects System**
Projects with `featured: true` appear in:

1. **Work Page Featured Section**: Rotational display of featured projects from all categories
2. **Sanity Admin**: Dedicated "Featured Projects" view for easy management
3. **Homepage** (if implemented): Can show featured projects

## 🔄 **Featured Projects Rotation System**

### **Current Implementation**
```typescript
// Get featured projects from all categories
export async function getFeaturedProjects() {
  return client.fetch(`
    *[_type == "project" && status == "published" && featured == true] 
    | order(publishedAt desc) {
      _id,
      title,
      slug,
      projectType,
      featuredImage,
      excerpt,
      publishedAt
    }
  `)
}
```

### **Work Page Featured Display**
The Work page now shows **category overview cards** instead of individual projects:
- **Fine Art Card**: Shows count + representative image from fine art projects
- **Tech Projects Card**: Shows count + representative image from tech projects  
- **Urban Planning Card**: Shows count + representative image from urban planning projects

### **Rotation Strategy Options**
You can implement featured project rotation by:

1. **Manual Rotation**: Toggle `featured` status in Sanity admin
2. **Automatic Rotation**: Implement time-based featured rotation
3. **Category Balance**: Ensure featured projects from each category get equal exposure

## 🎯 **Navigation & Routing Structure**

### **Work Page Categories (Overview)**
```
/work
├── Fine Art Projects (Card) → /portfolio/fine-art
├── Tech Projects (Card) → /portfolio/tech-projects  
└── Urban Planning Projects (Card) → /portfolio/urban-planning
```

### **Portfolio Category Pages (Collections)**
```
/portfolio/
├── fine-art/ → All Fine Art projects
├── tech-projects/ → All Technology projects
└── urban-planning/ → All Urban Planning projects
```

### **Individual Project Pages**
```
/projects/[slug] → Individual project detail pages
```

### **Navigation Menu Structure**
```
Work (Dropdown)
├── Fine Art
├── Tech Projects
└── Urban Planning ✅ ADDED
```

## 📊 **Project Data Flow**

### **Sanity Admin Portal** → **Website Display**

1. **Upload Project** → Set `projectType` → **Appears in correct category page**
2. **Mark as Featured** → Set `featured: true` → **Available for featured rotations**  
3. **Publish Project** → Set `status: published` → **Visible on website**

### **Category Filtering Logic**
Each portfolio page filters projects by type:

```typescript
// Fine Art Page
const fineArtProjects = allProjects.filter(
  project => project.projectType === 'fine-art'
)

// Tech Projects Page  
const techProjects = allProjects.filter(
  project => project.projectType === 'technology'
)

// Urban Planning Page
const urbanProjects = allProjects.filter(
  project => project.projectType === 'urban-planning'
)
```

## 🚀 **Ready to Use Features**

### ✅ **Implemented & Working**
